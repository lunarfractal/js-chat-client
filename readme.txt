if you're reading this I'm sure you're coming from discord
I wouldn't call myself a programmer because there is a difference between knowing how to write and compile code, and writing proper code.
for example, I should have hash-included the non-ssl version of the asio client but I'm stupid.
anyway this cpp file will still compile of you link the libraries

g++ client.cpp -o client -lssl -lcrypto

now, I yap a lot about this stuff but I've been going on with this for like 3 months at this point.
It's the mess which shouldn't have been created in the first place.
it all started with a timeout from charle
I'm gonna do something to dimden's hotel
I'm gonna gather a group of people to deal with countrysim
I'm gonna fix owop
